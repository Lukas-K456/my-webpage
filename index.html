 <h2>why i wanted to take computer studies</h2>
   </head>
   <body>i wanted to do coding because my dad is a programer
     and hes always talking about how cool it is so i wanted to see for myself, im also very interested on how videogames i play are coded and how developers can do awesome things in video games but another 
     reason is because i wanted to create my own videogame or website </body>

  <h3>what I like about school this year</h3>
  <p3>this school year didnt start off very good i got my least favorite subjects, (math and geography) but my teachers where really nice and fun i like their classe because they made class fun and enjoyable somtimes i got bored but it was still very fun. i wasnt very good at math but once i got the hangout of it, it was alot easier than before. But geophraphy took me forever to finally get the hang of it.</p3>
