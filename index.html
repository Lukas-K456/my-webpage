 <h2>why i wanted to take computer studies</h2>
   
    wanted to do coding because my dad is a programer
     and hes always talking about how cool it is so i wanted to see for myself, im also very interested on how videogames i play are coded and how developers can do awesome things in video games but another 
     reason is because i wanted to create my own videogame or website  
      
     


  <h3 Style="color:red">what I like about school this year </h3>

But geophraphy took me forever to finally get the hang of it.</p></b>
